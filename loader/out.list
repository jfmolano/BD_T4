BIOGRAPHY LIST
==============
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NM: "Ghost", Matthew Clark

NK: Ghost

HT: 5' 9"

BG: Richard Matthew Clark was born and raised in southeastern, NC, in a
BG: small town called, Chadbourn, NC.
BG: 
BG: He has a tragic tale filled with emotion that becomes one with the
BG: canvas he paints. Clark has a way through any media to lead you into a
BG: world that traps your soul.
BG: 
BG: His mother left him at six months old and his dad that's drinking almost
BG: destroyed the both of them.
BG: 
BG: His mother came back into his life when he was twelve only to attempt to
BG: murder him.
BG: 
BG: Art was his only outlet to express his emotion. His senior year in High
BG: School he excelled in the arts and was offered a full scholarship to
BG: the Parsons School of Art and the Art Institute, as well as, an
BG: internship with Marvel and Disney.
BG: 
BG: The light at the end of the tunnel was soon dimmed as he had to put his
BG: dad in a rehab clinic and drop out of school to save their home.
BG: 
BG: He saved their home but soon after his father was released from rehab
BG: his dad furious of being admitted into the treatment center, gave the
BG: home up any way and the two went their separate ways.
BG: 
BG: With no one to seek shelter with Clark found himself sleeping in a
BG: cemetery on a cement tomb staring at the sky seeking a way out.
BG: 
BG: He went to a local community college during the day where he obtained
BG: his adult high school diploma and joined the United States Army.
BG: 
BG: He found himself joining the military where he fought in the Infantry
BG: and forever tried to find a way back to the path to use his art. He is
BG: the type of person that has faced trial after trial but no matter how
BG: many times he has been knocked to the ground he has always managed to
BG: summon the strength to stand back up and face whatever the powers that
BG: be had to throw at him.
BG: 
BG: Trying to have a real family for once he married at 18 and had 2 sons by
BG: 21. His wife turned out to be just like his mom and ended up walking
BG: out on the family and never looking back.
BG: 
BG: He was a single father and left the military where he would sell
BG: sketches and paint murals for income.
BG: 
BG: 3 years past and he built a sign and graphics company and then married a
BG: female that tried to take what he had worked so hard to build. They had
BG: one child together and during the divorce proceeding the wife told the
BG: judge "Sir he can have the child I just want the money!" Clark threw
BG: the keys to her from across the court room and kept his 3 sons
BG: together.
BG: 
BG: He lost everything again but then kept the thing that mattered
BG: most....his children.
BG: 
BG: With just an airbrush left he went to the beaches of the Carolina's and
BG: started painting t-shirts for money. This fine artist that seemed to
BG: channel the spirits of the masters had been reduced to doing whatever
BG: it took art wise to eat.
BG: 
BG: He found himself working night and day to provide for everyone and with
BG: the street smarts he possessed he managed to turn money over and open
BG: an airbrush shop in the mall. Three years past and he met a bi racial
BG: girl that was born and raised in Germany. They dated for a while and
BG: she seemed to be the only one that could tame the battle tossed artist.
BG: 
BG: They were married in 2005 and now Clark finally has his family and now
BG: with four sons.
BG: 
BG: Although, Clark, has been through so much he always remains positive and
BG: humble and true to his southern charm. His work is able to captivate
BG: people from all walks of life and crosses over to all races, religions
BG: and backgrounds. His art is now world wide and his clients include
BG: everyone from the Ruff Ryderz, Warren Sapp and the Hollywood Elite.
BG: 
BG: Mr. Clark does everything from acting, producing, writing screenplays,
BG: set painting, special effects make up, music; and even owns custom body
BG: shops and mall stores, as well as, his own Production Company.
BG: 
BG: Born and raised in the Carolina's of the United States he is a hardened
BG: and battle tossed soul that still displays the characteristics of a
BG: leader. One that does not drink or use drugs; he stands as a knight
BG: making sure others do not have to struggle and feel the pain that he
BG: has known.

NM: 'Til Tuesday

BG: 'Til Tuesday were an excellent and intelligent 1980s New Wave rock
BG: quartet from Boston, Massachusetts. The group first got together in
BG: 1982. The band members were: Aimee Mann (vocals/bass), Robert Holmes
BG: (vocals/guitar), Joey Pesce (keyboards), and Michael Hausman (drums).
BG: Their music was distinguished by Mann's beautiful vocals, exceptionally
BG: literate lyrics, thoughtful and mature subject matter, and rich, lovely
BG: melodies. 'Til Tuesday started out playing around the Boston area and
BG: won Boston's WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble battle of the bands contest in
BG: 1983. They subsequently signed with the label Epic Records and released
BG: their debut album "Voices Carry" in 1985. The haunting and poignant
BG: titular tune was a substantial hit single; it peaked at #8 on the
BG: Billboard pop radio charts. The album also sold well; it reached #19 on
BG: the Top 20 album charts. Moreover, the music video for "Voices Carry"
BG: won the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Alas, the band's
BG: follow-up 1986 album "Welcome Home" was less successful; it barely
BG: cracked the Top 50 at #49 on the Billboard album charts. The moving
BG: song "What About Love" did a little better; it went all the way to #26
BG: on the Billboard pop radio charts. Although their third and final album
BG: "Everything's Different Now" received positive notices from music
BG: critics in 1988, it nonetheless was a complete commercial flop. 'Til
BG: Tuesday broke up in 1988. Aimee Mann has since gone on to have a hugely
BG: successful solo career while Michael Hausman serves as Mann's manager.

NM: 1, Todd

RN: Todd A. Brown

DB: 24 May 1970, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA

HT: 5' 7 1/2"

BG: Todd-1 is ready to take on the new millennium and prove to the
BG: entertainment world that his early success was no flash in the pan.
BG: From MTV to BET to ABC to Source All Access (Nationally Syndicated) to
BG: Interscope Presents the Next Episode (on Showtime), the multi-talented
BG: producer has paid his dues and the payoff is set for the year 2004.
BG: Born Todd Brown, the Brooklyn native showed early promise during his
BG: school years and definitely stood out amongst the crowd. He lists early
BG: rap stars KRS-One and LL Cool J as major musical influences and by age
BG: 16, he had begun to rap professionally. But although he desired a music
BG: career, Todd went off to college.
BG: 
BG: While studying Cable and Corporate Communications, Todd got his first
BG: taste of Television production. He took everything from `Speech' to
BG: `Remote TV Production' to `Physics of Music'. One day a fellow student
BG: came into class wearing a suit and told him about an internship
BG: interview that he was going to. He gave him the phone number and his
BG: call led to an internship with a growing company called MTV.
BG: 
BG: Rising from intern to production assistant to associate producer, Todd
BG: knew that he found his niche. He quickly bonded with Ted Demme, who
BG: took him on as his apprentice. During this time, the music world was
BG: revving its engines and the rise of prominent hip-hop and R&B groups
BG: were beginning to take over the charts. The show, MTV's 'Fade to Black'
BG: (which would later spawn the hit show 'MTV Jams') achieved strong
BG: ratings with Todd himself as the offbeat host, proved to be a real
BG: learning experience. Having worked with such premiere artists as
BG: Babyface, Janet Jackson, Shaquille O'Neal, TLC and Queen Latifah, it
BG: was a short time before he received the call to work at BET. Although
BG: he spent less than two years there, BET proved to be another stepping
BG: stone for the passionate Todd-1.
BG: 
BG: After a brief stint setting up the foundation for a Mike Tyson record
BG: label, Todd hooked up with friend and NBA star Derrick Coleman to form
BG: 44 Ways entertainment. Described it as a `full-service entertainment
BG: conglomerate which will catered to Music, Television and Film' Todd-1
BG: had his plate full running the day to day operations. 2 years later,
BG: Todd returned to his roots as a Producer of Hip Hop Television shows
BG: taking on the post of Supervising Producer at the nationally syndicated
BG: show - "Source All Access". It was during the hiatus of this show that
BG: he wrote his first screenplay entitled "Money Boys".
BG: 
BG: Currently Todd is the Producer of "Interscope Presents The Next
BG: Episode", airing on Showtime Networks. This is the first of its kind,
BG: Hip Hip docu-drama delving into the lives of future rap stars. Todd has
BG: relocated to Los Angeles and is looking forward to the upcoming
BG: challenges that await.

BG: Influenced mainly by horror B-movies and campy macabre shows and movies,

BG: lived. He then went on to form The Frankenstein Drag Queens From Planet
BG: 13 which lasted a total of 6 years along with a reunion which lasted
BG: for 1 year. His big breakthrough came when he formed The Murderdolls
BG: with Slipknot's Joey Jordison however the band was short lived with
BG: Joey focusing on Slipknot and Wednesday starting a solo career to which
BG: he is still active. The Murderdolls released a new album after an 8
BG: year hiatus. Wednesday also plays in side projects such as Bourbon Crow
BG: and Gunfire 76. He starred in a straight to DVD short entitled Weirdo a

TR: * Nominee, F***in' Problems, Best Rap Song, Grammy Awards 2014.
TR: * Rapper.

OW: * (2012) CD: "Based on a T.R.U. Story".
OW: * (2013) CD: "B.O.A.T.S. 2# Metime".

QU: * I've done a song with almost everybody in the game.
QU: * People know I work hard.
QU: * Entertainment is such a great job to have.
QU: * I enjoy being in control, having a lot of creative control.
QU: * I want to challenge myself, challenge my styles.
QU: * I wake up each and every day with a smile on my face knowing I get to do
QU:   something musically.
QU: * My whole story is just about me having a second chance.
QU: * I can say sincerely, don't take your voice for granted. It is truly what
QU:   makes us all equal.
QU: * I encourage everyone to pay attention to the issues that matter to you,
QU:   from jobs and the economy, to education and our schools, to criminal
QU:   justice reform. Whatever it is that you care about, make sure you use
QU:   your voice.
QU: * I want to be a successful landlord. I like real estate.
QU: * To me, I'm the epitome of what a ghetto child is: I was raised by a
QU:   single parent; I stayed in apartments my whole life; I don't think I've
QU:   ever cut the grass.
QU: * I had incorrectly, for all of my adult life until 2008, believed the
QU:   biggest voting myth that exists - that ex-felons cannot vote.
QU: * I don't have any reasons to be disrespectful or throw anybody under the
QU:   bus.
QU: * My pop did a little time.
QU: * I just be comfortable in my own skin; I might wear anything.
QU: * As I said, I spent most of my adult life thinking I didn't have a vote,
QU:   and therefore that what I thought didn't matter.
QU: * The independent route was the best move for me. But I think I've
QU:   maximized everything I could do independently. I've done everything out
QU:   the mixtape market. I think getting the big machine behind you is the
QU:   next stage when you've maximized the independent level.
QU: * You know, my uncle wore a lot of jewelry, a lot of gold chains.
QU: * I like for people to have fun and that comes out in the music.
QU: * You rarely get money out of labels, except for when they open up a
QU:   budget for a project. Other than that, it's a do-or-die type thing.
QU: * Hip-hop deals with bragging and braggadocio, being boastful. It's always
QU:   been about who's got the most money.
QU: * Ludacris is a very smart individual. He's about his business. Everything
QU:   is business with him. So I learned a lot about making deals from him.
QU: * You need to be your own individual.
QU: * In my 8th grade yearbook picture I had on 2 chains.
QU: * I don't care what anybody else is wearing. I feel like they're all
QU:   waiting to see what I have on. If you really want to know the truth,
QU:   that's what I think. They're waiting to see what I'mma do next.
